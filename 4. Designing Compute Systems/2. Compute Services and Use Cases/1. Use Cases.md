Consider these use cases:

- Early public clouds provided access to basic virtual machines, but cloud providers have expanded the type of compute services offered. Google Cloud Platform offers platform-足 as-足a-足service (PaaS) with App Engine.
- The ability to run small functions in response to events without setting up and managing servers for those functions is especially useful in distributed cloud applications. This capability is available with Cloud Functions.
- Containers are an efficient way to deploy distributed systems based on microservices, but managing a large number of containers quickly becomes a challenge. Google created its own container orchestration system and then released it into open source as Kubernetes. Google Cloud Platform now offers a fully managed Kubernetes service called Kubernetes Engine (known as GKE).
- Cloud users are increasingly adopting multicloud strategies. Google Cloud has introduced Anthos as an application management-足level service for managing policies and workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters running in GCP, on premises, and in other public clouds.
- AI and machine learning enable new kinds of services but require significant amounts of data to be stored, preprocessed, and used with machine learning algorithms. Several Google Cloud services are available to build scalable, performant data pipelines.
